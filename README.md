<h1 align="center">Book-Stand</h1>
Bookstand is a Full-Stack web-application built up with React JS in Front-End and Node JS, Express JS ad MongoDB in backend. In this App GraphQL also has been used with React as well as Express. One can Add a book with its genre and query it from front-end.

I have built this simple prototype app for implementing my learnings of GraphQL and NOdeJS. Please feel free to have a look at the source code and let me know your feedbacks.
